# Example docker-compose configuration

The example docker-compose configuration consists of two files

* `docker-compose.yml` contains two services: wikibase and mysql
* `docker-compose.extra.yml` contains additional services such as: wdqs, wdqs-frontend, elasticsearch and quickstatements 

**We recommend you go through `docker-compose.extra.yml` and remove any unwanted services.**

## Configure your installation

Copy the `template.env` to `.env` and replace the passwords and secrets with your own.

## Running a Wikibase instance

To run a Wikibase instance on port 80 run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start up the services defined in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), a Wikibase instance, database and a jobrunner.

## Jobrunner
The example docker-compose.yml sets up a dedicated job runner which restarts itself after every job, to ensure that changes to the configuration are picked up as quickly as possible.

If you run large batches of edits, this job runner may not be able to keep up with edits.

You can speed it up by increasing the `MAX_JOBS` variable, to run more jobs between restarts, if youâ€™re okay with configuration changes not taking effect in the job runner immediately.
Alternatively, you can run several job runners in parallel by using the `--scale` option.

```sh
docker-compose up --scale wikibase_jobrunner=8
```

## Running additional services

The wikibase bundle comes with some additional services that can be enabled.

- wdqs
- wdqs-updater
- wdqs-frontend
- quickstatements
- elasticsearch

### 1. Uncomment the extra-install scripts in `docker-compose.yml` 

In the volumes section of the wikibase service there is one commented line that automatically sets up the extensions needed for the additional services.

```
- ./extra-install.sh:/extra-install.sh
```

Looking inside extra-install.sh it executes two scripts that sets up an OAuth consumer for quickstatements and creates indicies for elasticsearch.

### 2. Uncomment MW_ELASTIC_HOST and MW_ELASTIC_PORT in `docker-compose.yml`

To configure wikibase to use elasticsearch we need to uncomment the following two lines in the example docker-compose.yml file
```
      - MW_ELASTIC_HOST=elasticsearch.svc
      - MW_ELASTIC_PORT=9200
``` 

### 3. Run with the extra configuration

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.extra.yml up
```
